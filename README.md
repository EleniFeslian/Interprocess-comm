# Interprocess Communication

## Project Structure

This project is organized into three main files:

- **`fun.h`**: A header file that contains function declarations, as well as any constants and variables that need to be accessible across all source files.
- **`fun.c`**: Implements the functions declared in `fun.h`.
- **`main.c`**: Contains the `main` function and handles the core functionality of the project based on the assignment requirements.

A **`Makefile`** is also included to simplify the compilation and execution process.
