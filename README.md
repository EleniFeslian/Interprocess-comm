# Interprocess Communication

\section*{Project Structure}

This project is organized into three main files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{fun.h}: A header file that contains function declarations, as well as any constants and variables that need to be accessible across all source files.
  \item \texttt{fun.c}: Implements the functions declared in \texttt{fun.h}.
  \item \texttt{main.c}: Contains the \texttt{main} function and handles the core functionality of the project based on the assignment requirements.
\end{itemize}

A \texttt{Makefile} is also included to streamline the compilation and execution process.
